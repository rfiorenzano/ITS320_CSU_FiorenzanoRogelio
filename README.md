Colorado State University Global - ITS320: Introduction to Programming - Student: Fiorenzano, Rogelio

Hello other developers!

This repository has been created to serve as a learning experience for myself and for others. The 
focus of the repository will be so other students can learn the benefits of leveraging an online 
tool, GitHub in this case, to begin practicing and utilizing a "version control-system." It will be a
means to provide others the ability to review the code that has been developed and provide advice or
support, and in other cases potentially provide inspiration on how to approach assignments.

I hope this clarifies the goal of this repository and how it can help many beginner developers with 
utilizing GitHub and provide a means for collaborative efforts.
